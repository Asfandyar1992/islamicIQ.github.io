An elderly man beside him said, “Allah replaces what you miss for Him with something better.” The words struck deeply. The young man began guarding his prayers strictly, even during work hours. Months later, he received a better job offer with flexible prayer breaks. He realized that success does not come from sacrificing worship, but from honoring it.",
